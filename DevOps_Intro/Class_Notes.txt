	Intro. about the DCP Course and Modules!
	
	
	Introduction to DevOps :::
	
		DevOps ???
		
		
		What is DevOps ???
		
		Software/Application ::
			
			Desktop Application
			Web Application
			Mobile Application
			
		Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
		
			Requirement Analysis 
			Design
			Code 
			Test
			Product Implementation
			Maintainence / Monitoring
			
		Waterfall Model :::
				- Completely Linear in fashion.
				- Top-Down Approach.	
				- It was meant for Monolith Applications
				
			Core_Project
				Requirement Analysis 		- (9-Months)
				Design
				Code 
				Test
				Product Implementation
				Maintainence / Monitoring		

			Enhancement_Project1
				Requirement Analysis 		- (9-Months)
				Design
				Code 
				Test
				Product Implementation
				Maintainence / Monitoring	

				
			Billing System :
			Web Application - E_commerce :
		
		Agile Methodologies :::
					- Modules / Iteration 

			Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
			
				Requirement Analysis 
				Design
				Code 
				Test
				Product Implementation
				Maintainence / Monitoring		
	
		Iteration1					Sign_up
			Requirement Analysis 
			Design
			Code 
			Test
			Implementation				Prod Implementation can be done only with proper approvals
			Maintainence / Monitoring		
	
		Iteration2					Sign_in
			Requirement Analysis 
			Design
			Code 
			Test
			Implementation
			Maintainence / Monitoring

		Iteration3					Search_product
			Requirement Analysis 
			Design
			Code 
			Test
			Implementation
			Maintainence / Monitoring			
	
		Iteration4					New_Feature
			Requirement Analysis 
			Design
			Code 
			Test
			Implementation
			Maintainence / Monitoring	
			
		Using AGILE Methodologies ::
		
			We can able to achieve :
			
				Continuous Development 
				
				Continuous Integration 
				
				Continuous Testing 
				
				Continuous Delivery 
						It is a process of releasing the changes to Production Environment with proper approval.
				
			We cannot achieve :
				
				Continuous Deployment
						It is a process of releasing the changes to Production Environment without any Manual approval.
				
		

		DevOps ::::
		
			DevOps is Software Development Strategy, that helps to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring in more automated fashion.
			
		How this can be achieved ???
		
			Teams ::: SDLC 
			
				Infra-Structure Management Team 
				Development Team 
				Testing Team
				Release Management Team 
				Production Support/Monitoring 
				Security Team 
				
			Application Architecture :::
			
					- Monolith Application Architecture
						- Tightly coupled applications 
						- It has lot of dependencies on each other
						- It is difficult to maintain / enhance the applications
						
						E_commerce :: www.amazon.com 
						
						sign_up		- developer1 --> code, test --> production???
						sign_in
						search
						add to cart
						checkout
						make payment 
						place order 
						track
						
			
					- Micro-Service Based Application Architecture
						- Loosely Coupled Applications
						- Modules/Iterations/functions is considered as a service, 
						- These services can be independently developed and deployed.
					
						E_commerce :: www.amazon.com 
						
						sign_up		- developer1 --> designed, coded, tested and independently released to production
						sign_in
						search
						add to cart
						checkout
						make payment 
						place order 
						track		
						
			Environments:::
			
				Non-Prod Environment										====>					Production Environment
				
					Dev Environment 
					Build Environment 
					Test Environment
						QA - Quality Assurance 
						UAT - User Acceptance Testing						===>						Prod Environment
					
				
				Application ::
				
					3 - Tier Application Architecture 
					
					Service :
					
					Sign_up				- apis call - end points
						
						Front_End Design 
						Application_Layer 
						Back_End Database 
						
						
			DevOps Stages :::
			
				Continuous Development :::
					
					- Main objective of Continuous Development is to improve the Developers' Productivity.
						
					Development Process :::
						
					
						Coding --> *.java
						Build --> Compile the code and create artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar)
						unit Testing 
						promote the changes for further testing 
						Notify the testing team 
						
					Using DevOps Approach :::
					
					
						Coding --> *.java		-- save the source code in a source code repository like GIT
						
							IDEs - Eclipse based IDEs - Visual Studio Code / Visual Studio / Pycharm / Intellij
						
					Using DevOps Automate :
						Automated Build --> Compile the code and create artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar)
						Automated Unit Testing 
						Automate - promote the changes for further testing 
						Automate - Notify the testing team 		

					Tools :::
								IDEs - Integrated Development Environment - Eclipse 
								GIT - Manage the Source Code 
								Jenkins - To automated the builds
					
						
					
				
					
				
				Continuous Integration
				
				Continuous Testing
				
				Continuous Delivery / Deployment 
				
				Continuous Monitoring

						Automated Unit Testing 
						Automate - promote the changes for further testing 
						Automate - Notify the testing team 		

					Tools :::
								IDEs - Integrated Development Environment - Eclipse 
								Build Tools - Maven/Gradle
								GIT - Manage the Source Code 
								Jenkins - To automated the builds
				
				Continuous Integration ::
				
					- Capability of the Development Teams to continuously integrate their changes for further Testing without impacting/waiting for others


					Using DevOps Automate :
						Automated Build --> Compile the code and create artifacts(Binaries - *.war/*.jar)
						Automated Unit Testing 
						Automate - promote the changes for further testing 
						Automate - Notify the testing team 	

					Tools :::
								GIT - Manage the Source Code 
								Jenkins - To automated the builds
								Docker,Kubernetes,Ansible for code promotion/Deployments
						
				Continuous Testing ::
				
					- It is a process of performing Continuous Testing using Testing Tools.
					
					Tools :::
								Junit 
								TestNG 
								Selenium 
								Jenkins 
				
				Continuous Delivery / Deployment 
				
					Continuous Delivery 
							It is a process of releasing the changes to Production Environment with proper approvals.		
							- Expect the downtime!

					
					Banking Applications :::
					
						Deployment Window / Production Release Window :
									4 - 6 hrs. - Non-Business 
									Thorough Prod Testing --> 
									
										- fix the issue.
										- revert the changes 
					
					Continuous Deployment
							It is a process of releasing the changes to Production Environment without any Manual approval.
							Without any Downtime!
